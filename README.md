# Payload Capture Azure Function Demo

This repository contains the source code for a very basic HTTP Triggered Azure Function that captures any payload posted to it and saves it, along with any request headers, to an Azure Storage Blob Container.

It also demonstrates Dynamic Output Binding, as the both blobs are created with Output Bindings added at runtime.
